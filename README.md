# Twitch Points Bot
## A Twitch chat bot which creates a points system with chat-game interactions

On twitch you can only get the channel points system for your channel once you reach a certain status in the Twitch pyramid (Twitch Affiliate). This means that anyone below this cannot use the channel points to get the same kind of user experience they otherwise would. 

This project is aimed at making a similar system through a chat bot and include some extra functionality which can all be configured through a web application made in Next.js.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack I am planning to use for this is:
- Python (Twitch Bot Functionality)
- SQL (Relational Databases)
- Next.js (Web Application)
